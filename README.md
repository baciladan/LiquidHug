# LiquidHug Online Store and Blog

I developed a web app that serves as an online store and blog for a fictional company named Liquid Hug ( I love Coffee!). <br/>

I organised my work for this project using the Agile Kanban Method wich made life a lot easier!<br/>

For the back end I used vanilla PHP, a strong scripting language that helped me give this project functionality. Main things I designed using PHP:<br/>
 &nbsp; -Login/Register System (With validations) <br/>
 &nbsp; -Online order System <br/>
 &nbsp; -Contact form <br/>

The database was built using MySQL. I also used MAMP for hosting the application while developing and testing. <br/>

For the Front-End part I used: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox and Grid) and vanilla JavaScript. <br/>

My main objective while developing this project was to build a friendly, easy-to-use User Interface and to learn more about web development. <br/>


Things I am looking to improve in the future: <br/>

&nbsp; -There is still a lot to work on the CSS part. The website needs more dinamism <br/>
&nbsp; -Add a more complex System for order tracking. <br/>
