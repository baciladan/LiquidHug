# LiquidHug

I developed a web app that serves as an online store and blog for a fictional company named Liquid Hug ( I love Coffee!).

I organised my work for this project using the Agile Kanban Method wich made life a lot easier!

For the back end I used vanilla PHP, a strong scripting language that helped me give this project functionality. Main things I designed using PHP:
  -Login/Register System (With validations)
  -Online order System 
  -Contact form

The database was built using MySQL. I also used MAMP for hosting the application while developing and testing.

For the Front-End part I used: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox and Grid) and vanilla JavaScript.

My main objective while developing this project was to build a friendly, easy-to-use User Interface and to learn more about web development.


Things I am looking to improve in the future:

 -There is still a lot to work on the CSS part. The website needs more dinamism
 -Add a more complex System for order tracking.
